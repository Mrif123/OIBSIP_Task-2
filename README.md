 The Unemployment Analysis with Python was done based on the two datasets that were one is Unemployment rate in India and one more was the dataset with the yearly data from the past year as the parameter for determining the Unemployment rate.

I analyzed the dataset provided by preprocessing the data,cleaning the data and also visualizing the Unemployment and employment rates of each state and also on the basis of the monthly Unemployment rates and employment rate visualized the data for better insights and also used the tool that is Microsoft Power BI for transforming the Data and also visualized the data and created valuable reports and dashboard and published it to gain the better and quick insights about the data and also understand about the relationship that exists between different attributes.
